Java puzzle game - move shuffled tiles to complete a picture

Written in Java using NetBeans.

- You need to sort-out shuffled image pieces and move them around to build the picture.
- Your time is being recorded.
- There are 2 available pictures and 3 difficulty levels (number of pieces).

The repository was just restored from a rather old backup (2014-10-19) without maintaining the code.

I don't plan to work on this program any further...
